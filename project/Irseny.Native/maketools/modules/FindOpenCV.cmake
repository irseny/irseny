# This script works with the existing OpenCVConfig.cmake from your specific Windows OpenCV build
# and tries to circumvent unconsidered shortcomings
# These include:
# - incompatibility with newer MSVC versions
# - not providing the full name and path to OpenCV libraries
# - not handing out runtime libraries on Windows platforms
#
# This script does not handle:
# - finding debug libraries
# - dependencies between runtime libraries

# This script can be configured with these variables:
# OpenCV_FIND_RUNTIME_LIBS - also search for runtime libraries AKA .dlls on Windows platforms
# OpenCV_FIND_QUIETLY - suppress all unavoidable output
# OpenCV_ARCH - processor architecture override, e.g. x64
# OpenCV_RUNTIME - msvc runtime override, e.g. vc14
# OpenCV_STATIC - whether to search for static libraries

# This script alongside OpenCVConfig.cmake sets these variables:
# OpenCV_FOUND - overall search success indicator
# OpenCV_ROOT_DIR - directory that contains OpenCVConfig.cmake
# OpenCV_LIBS - found link or runtime libraries
# OpenCV_LINK_LIBS - found link libraries (if not searching for static libs)
# OpenCV_STATIC_LIBS - found static libraries (if searching for static libs)
# OpenCV_RUNTIME_LIBS - found runtime libs (if searching for runtime libraries on the supported platforms)
# OpenCV_LIB_DIR - directory containing OpenCV libraries
# OpenCV_LINK_LIB_DIR - directory containsing OpenCV link libraries
# OpenCV_RUNTIME_LIB_DIR - directory containing OpenCV runtime libraries
# OpenCV_STATIC_LIB_DIR - directory containing static OpenCV libraries
# OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS - directories with OpenCV headers

# OpenCV_VERSION
# OpenCV_VERSION_MAJOR
# OpenCV_VERSION_MINOR
# OpenCV_VERSION_PATCH
